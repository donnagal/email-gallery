# Generate Icon Data

This `node` script creates a `json` file that maps an array of icons with metadata.

The data is then used on the icon library front end.

- Production url: https://email-gallery.netlify.app/pages/icons/
- Github repo: https://github.com/donnagal/email-gallery

## Data format

```js
type icon {
    // which brand the icon belongs to. cbus or media super
    group:"cbus"| "ms"|"none",

    // desription of the icon. used as keywords for sear
    text: string,

    // the url of the icon
    url: string,
};
```

- Replace all images in the `./images/` folder next to the script.

#### 2. Upload images to `AEM`

- The script will output a `json` file in the `/output` folder.

#### 4. Update the `items` array on the front end:
